Are you ready to get stuck into some React Router? For this challenge, you are required to code along with the lecturer from this lesson: [VanLife Project Bootstrapping](https://scrimba.com/learn/react/vanlife-project-bootstrapping-co8bc40b191eec875ecf00b23).

For this challenge you are required to code along with the lecturer from this lesson: https://scrimba.com/learn/react/vanlife-project-bootstrapping-co8bc40b191eec875ecf00b23

The starter code has all the CSS styling required for the project; you will just need to link the corresponding classes as you code along. Jump into the start code here: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/CodeSpace-Academy/StudentNo_Classcode_Group_Name-Surname_DJS08/tree/main).

The focus for this project will be to understand routing and present your code. Along with your code, you will need to submit a recorded presentation talking through the presentation points included below.

## React Routing Presentation Talking Points

For your recorded presentation, you will be discussing key concepts related to React Router, an essential tool for building single-page applications. To illustrate your understanding, address the following three questions in your presentation. These questions are designed to test your knowledge of the content from the "Advanced React Routing" Van Life Project, including setup, functionality, and application of React Router.

## Question 1: Explain the Setup and Basic Configuration of React Router

## Purpose of React Router:

# Single-Page Application Navigation: React Router allows for dynamic routing within a single-page application (SPA) without needing full page reloads, enhancing the user experience.
URL Management: It manages the URLs to reflect the current state and view of the application, making it easier to share specific parts of the app.
Setting Up React Router:

# Installation: First, install the package via npm or yarn:

npm install react-router-dom

## Defining Navigation Structure with <Routes> and <Route>:

Routes: This component wraps all the route definitions.
Route: Each <Route> defines a path and the component to render for that path.

## Question 2: Application of Route Parameters and Nested Routes

## Route Parameters:

Definition: Parameters in routes (e.g., :id) allow dynamic content rendering based on the URL segment.
Accessing Parameters: Use the useParams hook to retrieve parameter values.

Nested Routes:

Allows defining child routes within parent routes, enhancing modularity and layout consistency.
Benefits: Facilitates better organization and reuse of layout components.

## Question 3: Implementation of Navigation Controls and Dynamic Linking

<Link> Component:

Purpose: Provides navigation links to different routes in the application without reloading the page.

<NavLink> for Active Styling:

Difference from Link: NavLink adds styling to indicate the active route, enhancing user feedback.

# Search Parameters with useSearchParams:

Purpose: Enables dynamic content filtering based on query parameters.
Example: Filtering vans based on search criteria.

These points provide a comprehensive overview of React Router's setup, use of route parameters and nested routes, and navigation controls, with examples drawn from the Van Life project to illustrate each concept.

## Challenges:
Installation of dependencies, especially firebase.

## Feedback:
This project was very challenging but fun as well when it comes to the features I learned.
